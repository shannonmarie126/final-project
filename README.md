Supervised Machine Learning Model created using XGBoost to predict a History of mental illness based off of 14 socioeconomic factors. 
Preprocessing of the data included binning ages and incomes to prevent overfitting, ordinal encoding and dummies encoding for of the categorical data. SMOTE was used in the optimization model to synthesize data and decrease the imbalance in order to increase recall.
